This folder contains the source code of S-index. You can refer to the instructions below to install and use it.

## Requirements

To run the codes in this repository, you need to make sure that Anaconda is installed. The specific package versions can be found in the environment.yaml file and it worked well on windows11 and ubuntu 20.04. You can also build the environment with the following:

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate S-index
```

## Demo

A demo file is helpful for understanding how S-index predicts the synthesis difficulties of a target chromosome or genome. In the demo.ipynb, we provide instructions and test codes  for the analysis of JCVI_syn1.0 genome. You are free to change the demo sequence to the data of interest.
